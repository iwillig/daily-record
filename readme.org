* Daily Record

A tool for managing your work and knowledge.

This tool parsers your notes and builds a personal knowledge-base that
is designed to help you manage your work and personal life.

** Tools

Daily record uses Pandoc to parse a folder of notes. It then builds a
database based on Datalog that allows you to query for
information. Everything is built on GraalVM to ensure its fast. All
configuration is done in YAML.
